LangGraph Tutorial: Building Multi-Agent System with Plan-and-Excute


Welcome to this hands-on series, where I’ll walk you through the development of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) using LangGraph. I hope you find it enjoyable and informative!
 
I’ll demonstrate how to build a simple MAS with several agents, such as an email-sending agent, online search agents, and more. This system can automatically plan tasks based on the user’s prompt and execute them one by one. Additionally, it dynamically adjusts its to-do list after completing each task!
 
Stay tuned till the end for valuable insights and unique implementation techniques!
